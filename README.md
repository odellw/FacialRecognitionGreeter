# FacialRecognitionGreeter
A Facial Recognition Greeter for Code Tower at Babson College

TL-DR:
We duct-taped a Raspberry Pi to the wall, used a combination of OpenCV's built in facial recognition tools (EigenFace, FisherFace, etc...) to recognize the members of our living community and greet them with funny messages according to who they are.

Though the project was developed quite some time ago and maintains little to no documentation, I thought I would leave it here for future members of Code Tower in case they wished to rebuild it with the recognizer trained on the new memebers

A fun project I have been working on for the living community I am in at Babson College. Using facial recognition we were able to create a greeter that we have placed at the entrance of our living community, that detects and recognizes members of the community that walk in. 

Using Haarcascade for detection and OpenCV's EigenFace, FisherFace, and LBPHFace for recognition, we were able to create a greeter with surprising accuracy. It is currently trained on and has a custom greeting for 20 different members of our community.

Though the project had its ups and downs, it was certainly a great learning experience. Thanks to all those who let me take a bunch of pictures of them, and to Nicholas Bourdon for helping with the hardware.
